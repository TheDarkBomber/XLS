* XLS – The X Low-Level Language for Systems Developement
	XLS is a procedure-oriented low-level programming language that compiles to LLVM bytecode.
	As a result of compilation to LLVM bytecode, XLS inherits the portability features of LLVM.
* Syntax overview
** Numerical literals
	 In XLS, numerical literals are simple. ~534~ refers to the number literal 534 in base 10.
	 XLS also offers the ability to express number literals in other radices. For example,
	 ~0d534~ refers to the number literal 534 in base 10. :p

	 ~0xFF~ refers to the number literal FF in base 16, which is equal to 255 in base 10.
	 XLS also supports the following radices:
	 #+BEGIN_SRC xls
		 0b11; // Binary, base 2
		 0q33; // Quaternary, base 4
		 0s55; // Heximal, base 6
		 0d99; // Decimal, base 10
		 0xFF; // Hexadecimal, base 16
		 0nZZ; // Niftimal, base 36.

		 // Numerical literals are case insensitive
		 0xFF == 0xff;
		 0nZZ = 0nzz;
	 #+END_SRC
** Comments
	 Comments are performed using the standard C/C++ syntax.
	 #+BEGIN_SRC xls
		 // This is a comment.
		 // And so is this.
		 extern coldcc clygro(argument1, argument2); // This function is defined in clygro.xls
	 #+END_SRC
